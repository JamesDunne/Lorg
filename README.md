.NET 4.5 Exception Logging framework using content-addressable hashing to reduce storage requirements

Status
======
Very incomplete - work in progress.

Key Goals
=========
 * Efficient storage of exception reports in MS SQL Server (2008 R2 and up)
 * Simple to integrate into existing applications
 * Fast execution to remain as transparent as possible to the host application
 * Configurable logging policy per exception type
